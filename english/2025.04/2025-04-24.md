As night falls, an outdoor movie is playing in a public area in front of the Fisher Coffee shop on Shiquan Street in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, captivating residents. Nearby, lights flicker on the river as tourists on boats lift their phones to capture the enchanting scene.

The bustling street and tranquil river, along with the harmonious coexistence of tourists and residents, bring immense joy to He Qing, founder of the coffee shop and who has lived on this street for more than a decade.

"This street is steeped in culture, yet brims with the vibrancy of everyday life. Following last year's revitalization, our needs for living, entertainment and work can all be met without leaving the area," says He.
