China will raise additional tariffs on all goods imported from the United States to 84 percent, starting at 12:01 am on Thursday, and has added 18 US entities to its export control and unreliable entity lists in order to counter the US' unilateral tariff hikes.

Analysts said the countermeasures send a clear message that China, the world's second-largest economy, is prepared to stand firm in defense of its legitimate interests and the rules-based multilateral trading system.

On Wednesday evening, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Ministry of Education issued separate risk alert to tourists and students planning to go to the US.

Beijing's latest moves follow Washington's decision to increase its so-called "reciprocal tariffs" on Chinese goods to 84 percent, bringing the total additional tariffs imposed by the current Trump administration to 104 percent.

The Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, China's Cabinet, said in a statement on Wednesday that the US' decision to increase tariffs on Chinese goods is "a mistake upon a mistake".
