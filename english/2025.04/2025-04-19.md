My name is Mufizal Aboobucker, I'm a senior lecturer at the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in International Politics at the Central China Normal University in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, a journey that has been enriching, both academically and culturally. One of the most memorable parts is being able to visit scenic spots and immerse myself in Wuhan's vibrant culture.

In the course of my PhD, I have had the opportunity to engage in academic discussions and research collaboration with scholars from other universities in the city. This engagement has greatly broadened my perspective on international politics, and deepened my understanding of China's role in global affairs. As a significant education and research hub, Wuhan is home to a number of prestigious universities and research institutions.

Aside from my academic endeavors, I make sure to explore the city's most famous landmarks and cultural sites. These visits have not only provided much-needed breaks from my studies, but have also allowed me to appreciate the city's beauty and history.
