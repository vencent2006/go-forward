The report highlighted the industry's steady expansion, fueled by shifting consumer behavior and an increasingly younger pet-owning demographic.

The pet market recovery signals not only an economic rebound, but also a deeper emotional and financial commitment from pet owners, said the report.

"The growth in the urban pet market underscores a transformative shift in consumer behavior," said Liu Xiaoxia, founder of PetData. "Pet owners are increasingly prioritizing the health and happiness of their animals, which bodes well for the entire industry."

Pet owners are getting younger. One of the most significant changes in 2024 was the shifting demographic of pet owners. Those born in the 1990s still account for the largest share at 41.2 percent, but this figure dropped by 5.4 percentage points from the previous year. Meanwhile, pet owners born in the 2000s surged to 25.6 percent, up by 15.5 percentage points.

"This rise of the post-2000s generation as pet owners is a wake-up call for businesses," Liu said. "They are a generation that demand high-quality products, transparency in sourcing, and a seamless shopping experience. Brands that fail to adapt will find it difficult to remain competitive."
