On Saturday, the Chinese government released its position opposing the US' abuse of tariffs. Additionally, on Friday, China announced its decision to levy an additional 34 percent tariff on all imports from the United States, effective from April 10. This move serves as a countermeasure against US tariff threats.

On April 2, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency on grounds of "national security" concerns to address the persistent and vast US trade deficit. By imposing a 10 percent base tariff on global imports and additional differentiated tariffs on key economies—including China and the European Union—Trump's administration has escalated its trade policy into what can only be described as a systemic trade war. Unlike the selective sanctions of previous administrations, this new approach transforms trade disputes into an all-encompassing economic confrontation, challenging the post-war, WTO-based multilateral trade order.
