European Union finance ministers have expressed support for establishing a joint defense fund aimed at collectively purchasing and owning military equipment.

The initiative, prepared by the Bruegel think tank, reflects broader strategic intentions to enhance the EU's defense capabilities amid evolving security threats and the diminishing reliability of US security guarantees.

The proposed European Defense Mechanism, or EDM, envisions an intergovernmental fund where nations would contribute direct investment to establish a shared financial pool, reported Reuters.

This initial funding would be leveraged to secure additional market financing, enabling both EU and non-EU countries to collectively acquire and maintain military assets through joint procurement.

While there is general support for the concept, some member states, including France, Germany, and Belgium, have emphasized the importance of utilizing existing financial instruments, such as the European Investment Bank, the European Defense Fund, and the ReArm Europe plan, before establishing new mechanisms.
