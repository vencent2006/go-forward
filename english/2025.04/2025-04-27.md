As Guizhou province prepares to unveil what will be the world's tallest bridge, its main suspension cables are receiving a fire-resistant and anticorrosion treatment, which is said to be able to withstand temperatures of up to 1,100 C for a full hour without so much as a singe.

Measuring 2,378 meters, the main cables of the Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge are vital components designed to bear the bridge's weight. Once installed, however, these steel giants are nearly impossible to replace or repair without undertaking a full-scale rebuild. That vulnerability makes fire a particular concern.

"In a fire, cables can be seriously damaged," explained Wu Huijuan who is responsible for the fire-treatment project. "High temperatures can change the cable's properties and structure, risking collapse."

Wrapped in protective wire and multiple protective layers, the cables are engineered to resist rust and extreme heat. A single main cable consists of 217 compacted strand bundles, which in turn contain 91 high-strength, 5.7 mm steel wires.
