The Communist Party of China has launched a four-month campaign to urge its around 100 million members to bolster compliance with a code of conduct that has strengthened the Party over the past 12 years.

This education campaign on the eight-point rules was planned by none other than China's top leader Xi Jinping. During his inspection tour to Southwest China in March, Xi urged Party organs at all levels to meticulously organize and implement the campaign.

He called for fighting misconduct and corruption as a whole, and making relentless efforts to root out the underlying conditions for corruption.

Exercising full and rigorous Party self-governance has been a signature and cornerstone of Xi's leadership. In his first media appearance as the newly elected general secretary of the CPC Central Committee in November 2012, he candidly acknowledged that the Party faced "numerous severe challenges", with corruption being a primary concern.

He immediately started addressing the issue by tackling the deteriorating conduct of officials â€” some had indulged in extravagance, grown content with empty formalities, or put on an air of bureaucracy.
