The PBOC also agreed with its Brazilian counterpart to deepen local currency cooperation and expedite the interlinking of cross-border QR code payment systems.

In May, the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS — which specializes in renminbi cross-border payments and clearing — and the Central Bank of the UAE signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance cross-border payment connectivity and provide local currency clearing services for financial institutions in the Middle East and North Africa.

"Efforts to promote local currency settlements and interoperability between cross-border payment systems will help reduce reliance on the US dollar and other single currencies, thereby mitigating risks arising from major currency fluctuations," Zheng said.

As a more direct signal of the renminbi playing a bigger role in safeguarding regional financial stability, ASEAN+3 financial leaders last month endorsed the creation of a Rapid Financing Facility under the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation, which incorporates eligible non-dollar currencies — including the Chinese renminbi — as financing options for member economies to deal with emergencies.
