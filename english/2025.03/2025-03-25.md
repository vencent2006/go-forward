Asian economies, with real GDP growth projected to be 4.5 percent for 2025, will continue to play a crucial role in driving global economic stability and growth, said a report released on Tuesday at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2025.

The forum comes soon after the China Development Forum 2025, which ended on Monday, and gathered top government officials and business leaders from across the globe. Experts said the forums' key message is crystal clear, that Asia — spearheaded by China — is reinforcing its commitment to openness and stability, presenting a sharp contrast to the rising economic isolation featured by the United States' arbitrary sanctions and tariffs.
