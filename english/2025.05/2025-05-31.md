OKLAHOMA CITY â€” Oklahoma City, sparked by 34 points from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2012 by routing Minnesota Timberwolves 124-94 on Wednesday.

Gilgeous-Alexander, the NBA Most Valuable Player, added eight assists and seven rebounds as the Thunder captured the best-of-seven Western Conference finals series 4-1 and will host Game 1 of the NBA Finals on June 5.

"This is a step in the right direction but we have a lot more work to do and we know that and that's what we're focused on so let's buckle up and get ready," said Gilgeous-Alexander.

"We've got a lot of work to do to get to our ultimate goal and this is not it. That's all that I'm focused on."

Oklahoma City will face the Eastern Conference champion, either the Indiana Pacers or New York Knicks, for the NBA title.

Gilgeous-Alexander, a 26-year-old Canadian who was named the series MVP, could become the first NBA scoring champion since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 to win an NBA title in the same season.
