Central and Eastern European countries' expanding cooperation with China will further energize regional economic activity and deepen industrial integration in the coming years, said senior government officials on Thursday.

Speaking at the ongoing fourth China-CEEC Expo in Ningbo, East China's Zhejiang province, which runs from Thursday to Sunday, they said the partnership between China and the CEEC has transitioned from policy coordination to practical results, with growing two-way trade, big-ticket infrastructure projects, and green and digital industry cooperation taking center stage.

Richard Rasi, chairman of the Slovak National Council, said Slovakia welcomes Chinese investment, particularly in projects that offer added value in innovation, research and development, and new technologies.

These projects, led by Chinese companies — including battery maker Gotion High-tech Co and automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group — will not only drive regional development in Slovakia, but also further strengthen the country's leading position in the field of electric mobility in Europe, said Rasi.
