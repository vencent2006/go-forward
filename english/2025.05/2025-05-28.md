## English
The most widely known explanation of eating zongzi (sticky rice dumplings) during the Dragon Boat Festival is to commemorate Qu Yuan (340-278 BC). When Qu Yuan, the patriotic poet of the Chu State, drowned himself in the Miluo River, the local people were heartbroken. They threw glutinous rice into the river to prevent fish and shrimp from eating his body. Over time, this practice evolved into the tradition of making and eating zongzi.

Zongzi also holds cultural significance beyond commemoration. The use of bamboo or reed leaves to wrap the glutinous rice symbolizes the connection between humans and nature. Different fillings, such as red beans, meat or dates, not only add flavor but also reflect regional culinary traditions. Eating zongzi during the festival has become a way for families to gather, share in the celebration, and pass down cultural heritage from one generation to the next.
