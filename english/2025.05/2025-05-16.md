People love celebrating, and there are lots of wonderful family celebrations. Some celebrations happen all around the world, like lantern parades. These parades are popular,for example in Thailand or Costa Rica.  

Some families make lanterns at home. At night, young people go outside with their lanterns, and parents or grandparents and light up the night. Other celebrations are only popular in a few countries.  In Spain, everyone starts eating twelve grapes at midnight to celebrate the New Year.  

And people in Rio de Janeiro wear white clothes on the beach as a sign of peace. Many families have their own special family traditions, some of these traditions are very old. These traditions are a way of learning about your family and your family history. In our busy lives, family traditions can help us stay together and feel close to each other.  

They are exciting and make nice memories. Family traditions can turn a normal daily activity—like having dinner—into something special, like having your birthday dinner at restaurants. Fun family traditions can include picking apples in autumn, planting trees or flowers, or cooking a special sweet or savory meal once a year.
